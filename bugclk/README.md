CLK-BUG
A simple, TTL clock bug-board.  Allows limited control of frequency including a 1PPS (nominal) output and
a sine output option using DDS and an 8-bit DAC (max freq approx 10 KHz).

Frequency is controlled with a 10's and 1's Hex switch and a multiplier hex switch.  Allows frequencies from sub-Hz
up to the max range of the timer peripheral (100KHz is a practical limit).
