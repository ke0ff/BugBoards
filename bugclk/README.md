BUG-CLK<br>
A simple, TTL clock (5V, but can run at 3.3V if the HC244 devices are sourced with a wide supply range) bug-board.  Allows limited control of frequency and includes a TTL 1PPS (nominal) and
a sine output option using DDS and an 8-bit DAC (max freq approx 10 KHz).

Frequency is controlled with a 10's and 1's Hex switch and a multiplier hex switch.  Allows frequencies from sub-Hz
up to the max range of the timer peripheral (100KHz is a practical limit).
